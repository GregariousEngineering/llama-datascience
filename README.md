# Llama Data Science ðŸ¦™

**Your Personal AI Data Scientist on the Command Line!**

Ever wished you had a senior data scientist on speed dial? Now you do! Llama Data Science is a powerful command-line tool that connects you with a brilliant AI data scientist, ready to analyze your data, answer your toughest questions, and even whip up visualizations in seconds.

Harness the power of Large Language Models running locally on your machine to turn data into insights, instantly.

## Why You'll Love It ðŸš€

-   **Interactive AI Chat**: Go beyond simple queries. Have a full conversation with your AI partner to explore your data from every angle.
-   **Safe & Secure**: All Python code is executed in a secure, isolated sandbox. Your data and your machine are always safe.
-   **Instant Visualizations**: Ask for a plot, and get it! The AI uses libraries like Matplotlib to generate charts and save them directly to your disk.
-   **Blazing Fast Answers**: Get immediate responses to one-off questions without leaving your terminal.
-   **BYOM (Bring Your Own Model)**: Works with any Ollama-compatible model. You have complete control over the AI brainpower you want to use.

## Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites

-   **Python 3.x**
-   **Ollama**: Make sure you have [Ollama](https://ollama.com) installed and running. You'll also need at least one model pulled.

    ```bash
    # Example: Pull the Mistral model
    ollama pull gpt-oss
    ```

### 2. Installation

Install the necessary Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install llm_sandbox ollama termcolor
```

## How to Use

Unleash your AI data scientist in two powerful modes.

### Quick Question Mode

Have a single, burning question? Get a fast answer.

```bash
./llama_datascience.py "What are the column names and data types in my dataset?" --data-file /path/to/your/data.csv
```

### Interactive Chat Mode ðŸ’¬

For deeper analysis, fire up the interactive chat. This is where the magic happens!

```bash
./llama_datascience.py --data-file /path/to/your/data.csv
```

You'll be greeted by the AI and can start asking questions. To end the session, just type `exit` or `quit`.

Best hour (lowest average traffic): 2h

--- Expert Reasoning Step 3/20 ---
**Best time to travel South**

The hour with the lowest average vehicle count for the Southâ€‘bound direction is **2â€¯h** (the 2â€¯:00â€¯â€“â€¯3â€¯:00â€¯AM slot).  
Across all days in the data set, the average count for that hour is about **23 vehicles**, and the smallest singleâ€‘day count recorded in that hour is **4 vehicles**.

So, if you want the least traffic when heading South through the intersection, aim for the 2â€¯:00â€¯â€“â€¯3â€¯:00â€¯AM window.
